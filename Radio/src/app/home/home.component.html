        <p>Internet radio is an audio service that uses the Internet as a distribution medium
          of broadcasting instead of the traditional radio waves. The proper term used for internet
          radio is webcasting, as it is not actually broadcast through wireless signals.
          It is a form of streaming media where content is usually provided live instead of being
          prerecorded like some podcasts.</p><br>
